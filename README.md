# Serverless Framework AWS NodeJS Star Wars

## Usage

### Deployment

In order to deploy the example, you need to run the following command:

```
$ serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying aws-node-project to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-node-project-dev (112s)

functions:
  hello: aws-node-project-dev-hello (1.5 kB)
```

### Local development

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```
    "existingRoutes": [
        "get  - /dev/db/people",
        "get  - /dev/db/people/{id}",
        "get  - /dev/people",
        "get  - /dev/people/{id}"
        "post - /dev/people/add",
    ]

```
